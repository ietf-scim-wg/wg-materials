WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:06.570
All right welcome everyone. Um, this is.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.019
A, um, skin.

3
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.179
Virtual interim session, and we are recording.

4
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.429
We are also following the procedures, so the note well applies, um.

5
00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:37.140
I think most of you have joined in the past so you should be familiar with and as well, which is basically describing the code of conduct and.

6
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.049
Process and procedures for how we conduct our sessions. Um.

7
00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:46.409
I wanted to go ahead and get started with the.

8
00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.179
Agenda bashing. Oh, my apologies. Aaron.

9
00:00:51.179 --> 00:01:01.350
I forgot to add you here. See, this is what I get for doing it last minute. So, 1st, order of business. I want to welcome.

10
00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.939
Our Co chair for this.

11
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.150
Group and that's Erin.

12
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.689
So, welcome, Eric, I don't know if you wanted to say anything.

13
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.010
Oh, you're on mute many audio buttons. There we go. There. You go.

14
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.040
Nice to be here. Thanks.

15
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.579
Or having me, um, so, yeah, I'll just give a little background on myself. I'm, um.

16
00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.349
Primarily been involved with the groups that you may know me from from that world.

17
00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:55.859
And I work at Octa doing primarily training education around and security concepts. So this I've been involved with the.

18
00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.659
Oscar for quite a while uh, but probably most.

19
00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.500
Actively since, I don't know, 4 years ago or so.

20
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.270
Um, and this, this is my 1st role as a chair so I am new to that side of the process.

21
00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.889
Well, I'm I'm much appreciative of you willing to CO chair with me so I'm.

22
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.250
I'm looking forward to our engagement here.

23
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.020
Okay, so, um, that said.

24
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:37.229
I had come into your call to be 1 of our note takers. Could I have a 2nd, and potentially a 3rd 1 I've got the link up here.

25
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:46.409
It would be great if we had more than 1 just so that we can capture it and follow perhaps later.

26
00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.879
If you can help me with the, uh.

27
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.659
Text extraction, you know, I can, um.

28
00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.689
For completing that up too. Sure.

29
00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.039
Anybody else who could help with a notetaking?

30
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.520
Hello? Hello?

31
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.729
I'm just not feeling so. Well, today, Nancy, so I'm not putting. Oh, okay.

32
00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:30.539
Sorry, no, no worries. I'm happy to to charge in solo, Nancy. If that helps.

33
00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:36.870
Okay, I very much appreciate it. Okay. So that said.

34
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.169
I, we need to figure out how we can get this group to be more.

35
00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:50.129
More vocal on the males on on the slide channel, because I, I did ask for.

36
00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.750
Proposals for agenda items.

37
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.189
I didn't get any, but the 1st, 2.

38
00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.409
Orders of business that is in our charter is to update the use cases.

39
00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.469
As well as the schemas and protocols.

40
00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:15.449
Phil, thank you. You did provide me some feedback for adding something for the.

41
00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.790
Uh, 113 and so I've got a proposed.

42
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:29.129
Set of items that we can discuss towards, you know, we'll reserve the last 10 minutes of of the call to go through.

43
00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.848
Through the agenda for iatf 113.

44
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.528
Is there anything else that.

45
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:42.119
Ah, the group wants to bring up besides.

46
00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:45.329
The updates on the use cases.

47
00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.819
And the schema and the protocol updates.

48
00:04:55.738 --> 00:05:03.389
No, I've got 1 or 2 topics. Um, there are things like drafts aren't even written about just.

49
00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.939
Things that I'd like to drum up interest for maybe in, uh, solving certain problems.

50
00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.649
Uh, with the, the current spec, so towards the end.

51
00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:19.468
Okay, like, how to, uh, securely handle pictures it'd be the big 1.

52
00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:26.879
How to securely handle? What photos your pictures.

53
00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.968
Oh.

54
00:05:29.968 --> 00:05:38.728
Okay, so also at the end of the agenda, if we don't mind talking a little bit about some housekeeping, I created a.

55
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:41.848
Get hub repo to collaborate yes.

56
00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:47.488
Hoping that we can collaborate there. I've shared it with a couple of people.

57
00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:58.499
Excellent. All right. So, um.

58
00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:10.139
Since Pam is not here, uh, Danny and jenelle. I know you're not feeling well, but can we get an update on how the use cases.

59
00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.408
Um, work is progressing.

60
00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:22.139
Sure, so I had a call with Pam and, uh, 1 of the other people at Microsoft has involved with him. Uh, recently.

61
00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.468
And, um, I'm not sure, like, precisely how much progress since.

62
00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:33.088
The last draft that Pam shared, at least, uh, with.

63
00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:38.249
Like, some of the people who are editing, like, I'm not sure how much move on there has been a.

64
00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:41.903
Barely substantial amount of work on it.

65
00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:54.533
Honestly, it feels closer if my memory is correct to a rewrite of youth cases, rather than, you know, the processing of Arata and, uh, you know, small like, clarification fixes.

66
00:06:56.608 --> 00:07:08.694
But there's a decent amount of work there. Um, I'm not sure how much has happened in the past few weeks specifically. Tim has had a period of, uh, you know, more problems to solve than she has been with the solve them.

67
00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:23.814
Uh, but she's working on correcting that so that she can get us to the point of having a draft ready by, uh, June and that's totally well, that's totally fine. As long as there's progress being made. And perhaps for 2013, um.

68
00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:33.059
You and Pam, you know, the, the team that's focused on use cases can talk about.

69
00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:37.168
The the current thinking of the use cases that we're going to cover.

70
00:07:37.168 --> 00:07:41.069
I think that would be important for us to go through.

71
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.689
Yeah, and I have 1 more addition from Elliot I.

72
00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:52.769
He was going to provide some content to share with Pam for the device use cases. Awesome.

73
00:07:52.769 --> 00:07:59.038
I presume that would be the case cause at the last call. I, I recall we.

74
00:07:59.038 --> 00:08:04.019
We had unanimous agreement that it should be covered.

75
00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:07.889
Um, so I would expect that to be in the use case.

76
00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:13.468
Thanks Chanel. Um, do you want to give Elliott a reminder.

77
00:08:13.468 --> 00:08:16.978
So, it sounds to me that there won't be a.

78
00:08:16.978 --> 00:08:23.819
Even a rough draft that would get submitted because I think the deadline for the 00 submissions is next week.

79
00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:32.578
And that's just, you know, that's typical procedure for the for a week before actually, 2 weeks before.

80
00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:36.658
The sessions they freeze the server typically, because they need to.

81
00:08:36.658 --> 00:08:40.048
The shift towards the face to face meeting.

82
00:08:40.048 --> 00:08:49.318
But then the, um, the portal gets opened up again, um, so that we can submit while we were at.

83
00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:53.938
But my point here is is to ask the question.

84
00:08:53.938 --> 00:08:56.999
Whether there be even a rough outline.

85
00:08:56.999 --> 00:09:02.278
Whether you've used cases, do you know Danny?

86
00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:05.879
I, I'm, I'm not.

87
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:12.418
Sure, I'd have to check with Pam. I know she, she's presented to us, but I, I don't know that it's.

88
00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:16.528
In, uh, sort of, you know, like the, the.

89
00:09:16.528 --> 00:09:20.519
Forum versus, you know, like 5 on a PowerPoint or word doc or anything like that. Okay.

90
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:23.668
Well, I mean, at this point, you know.

91
00:09:23.668 --> 00:09:28.198
It, if it's not ready to be an RFC form.

92
00:09:28.198 --> 00:09:33.298
Even just having a rough outline presented of and again right?

93
00:09:33.298 --> 00:09:36.839
Not conforming to the RC if you're not ready, but at least.

94
00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:42.328
Outlining the different use cases that we want to cover.

95
00:09:42.328 --> 00:09:45.418
Just so we can have discussions.

96
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:50.009
Yeah, I can check with her and just get back on the on the mailing list or.

97
00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:53.099
Great thanks.

98
00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:56.219
Okay um, so that's.

99
00:09:56.219 --> 00:10:02.428
Oh, it just seems like a good time to add this comment because.

100
00:10:02.428 --> 00:10:05.698
I haven't written a draft in 2 or 3 years.

101
00:10:05.698 --> 00:10:09.719
I recommend anybody who's going to write a draft.

102
00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:12.958
Or hasn't yet submitted to, um.

103
00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:22.109
Plan to attend the draft writing seminar that they will likely have over the weekend before. It's usually when it's held.

104
00:10:22.109 --> 00:10:26.788
I found there were enough changes. It took me 2 days.

105
00:10:26.788 --> 00:10:30.688
As an old XML draft writer to figure out.

106
00:10:30.688 --> 00:10:36.328
All the changes that have occurred and to debug it all. It's a little bit.

107
00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:43.349
Tedious it's gotten more powerful, but it's tedious. And I think, uh, I'm going to attend.

108
00:10:43.349 --> 00:10:46.408
Um, just to get all of the tips and tricks.

109
00:10:46.408 --> 00:10:52.288
Um, and that will save you a lot of time. So if you haven't already committed to publishing.

110
00:10:52.288 --> 00:11:01.288
But you're going to I would, that would be a good session. It has been in the past that you just go. Oh, that's why it's this way, you know, and.

111
00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:13.168
Um, that's a personal experience there. Yeah. Thanks for pointing that out Phil and the I need to add in the chat so I would be interested in seeing that.

112
00:11:13.168 --> 00:11:20.879
Yeah, yeah, I also I had the privilege of having Elliott give me a slight tutorial on.

113
00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:34.078
The the marked on files and using cram down. Yeah. And so part of my goals in the last week, or 2 is to try to get a boilerplate, just template going um, that may be share.

114
00:11:34.078 --> 00:11:38.068
Um, I thought Martin Thompson.

115
00:11:38.068 --> 00:11:44.548
So, Phil, I don't know if if you got it in the last tutorial, but, um.

116
00:11:44.548 --> 00:11:48.899
There was some tooling that is made available.

117
00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:54.178
And get hub that gives you basically.

118
00:11:54.178 --> 00:11:58.349
The main file, if you will for how to take mark down.

119
00:11:58.349 --> 00:12:02.369
All the way to, um, and it does also show you.

120
00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:08.188
The steps for installing crammed down an XML to.

121
00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:20.219
Yeah, I've, um, I tried that briefly. Um, and I found certain things are faster than certain things are much slower. So I reverted back to.

122
00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:23.788
Ah, but to your point, um.

123
00:12:23.788 --> 00:12:29.818
Under GitHub under I think it's the tools account.

124
00:12:29.818 --> 00:12:41.849
There's a series of things like XML to RFC. There's a markdown converter. They run actually better. I found if you download them or clone them and then do a make file as you say.

125
00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:45.958
Um, and certain things happens, like 1 of the things that, um.

126
00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:55.469
I kept now supports instead of text based diagrams. You can now do diagrams you can do a web sequence diagram and have it look good.

127
00:12:55.469 --> 00:12:59.428
Um, so there's a bunch of tools there as well.

128
00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:05.969
I haven't gone to a recent session. That's my plan is to go to the the next session. So.

129
00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:09.839
Um, but this is what I figured out over a couple of days and, um.

130
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:17.519
I found the tools and GitHub to be invaluable. So, and if you're going to go with Markdown yeah. Look to those tools.

131
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:22.379
And so forth, um, I remember.

132
00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:28.288
Yeah, I, I was just going to say if I remember, or if any 1 of you, um.

133
00:13:28.288 --> 00:13:32.969
See them, if you can post them to the slack channel, the general.

134
00:13:32.969 --> 00:13:37.769
Skim slack That'll be useful for everybody to.

135
00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:43.109
I dropped a link in in this chat, but in under the notes, but I'll put it in Slack as well.

136
00:13:43.109 --> 00:13:56.609
Awesome. Thanks, Paul. I've got a folder of bookmarks with all the various bits and pieces. I've done the full journey of Mark down, or crammed down into XML into RFC a couple of months ago.

137
00:13:56.609 --> 00:14:01.739
Re, producing that might be a little trickier than.

138
00:14:01.739 --> 00:14:09.808
Well, and the tools do keep getting updated as well. Right? Every year some of the copyright stuff changes. Um.

139
00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:16.379
Yeah, and just in general, like Ruby caught me by surprise. I think it was last year.

140
00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:20.609
Last year yeah. Was an, it was just.

141
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:24.269
The general tools. All right.

142
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:32.068
I'll spin up a new channel in Slack for discussion of, um, writing documents, tools, best practices, et cetera.

143
00:14:32.068 --> 00:14:35.369
Great. Sounds like a great channel. Thanks.

144
00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:42.269
Okay, now that we did the little sidetrack.

145
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:49.678
Which was useful we do, we eventually need to get them to be in the template.

146
00:14:49.678 --> 00:14:52.918
Performance. Okay so.

147
00:14:52.918 --> 00:15:04.168
Let's move on to the schemas and the protocol RFCs and I expect them to be new drafts as well. It's not going to be Errata.

148
00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:08.908
Um, Danny and jenelle again.

149
00:15:09.203 --> 00:15:11.394
Updates well,

150
00:15:11.394 --> 00:15:11.693
Danny,

151
00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:17.274
and I were discussing new versus drafts and 1 of the revisiting the charter,

152
00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:23.063
and 1 of the goals of the charter was actually to take the skim to to an Internet draft,

153
00:15:23.063 --> 00:15:24.474
which it is an app today.

154
00:15:24.474 --> 00:15:38.274
And so we were thinking of, maybe we do need to do a quick pass on the Arata and basically get it into shape so that we can all agree and say, yep, that looks like skim 2.0. we'll agree. That's the standard take it there.

155
00:15:38.274 --> 00:15:41.153
Um, and then continue forward on the.

156
00:15:41.938 --> 00:15:46.589
Beyond skim 2.0 work that we've discussed. Okay.

157
00:15:46.589 --> 00:15:52.828
Does that sound? Does everybody agree to that in this space?

158
00:15:52.828 --> 00:16:00.028
Can we take a vote? Well, we, we need to start that discussion. Um.

159
00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:09.418
I was going to say justification isn't the right word if you can walk us through, um, jenelle for.

160
00:16:10.528 --> 00:16:16.139
The journey that you're taking, right for the path that we'll end up going. I'm trying to.

161
00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:23.668
To be more flexible on whatever that path is that you want to design for the group.

162
00:16:23.668 --> 00:16:29.698
Um, would go through.

163
00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:34.708
Are you talking janela just to clarify? Because it's.

164
00:16:34.708 --> 00:16:38.548
Sounds like what we should do 1st, is get the list of.

165
00:16:38.548 --> 00:16:45.119
Let's call the bugs for now and determine whether they're truly irada or whether they're enhancements.

166
00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:50.158
Yes, then decide. Yeah, and and 1 of the things that.

167
00:16:50.158 --> 00:16:56.308
On the side, what's the leader in the agenda to GitHub? Repo I set up 1 that.

168
00:16:56.308 --> 00:17:01.259
Looks kind of like the other working groups, uh, for.

169
00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:06.209
I don't know if it's exactly right or not. Um.

170
00:17:06.209 --> 00:17:17.098
And and Danny, and I were just discussing using GitHub to track all those issues, and then carry them forward into, you know, the different buckets that they should be in.

171
00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:31.919
And, uh, we thought we could could group collaborate that way? Um, if we all agree that that's the appropriate place to, to track all the, the things.

172
00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:36.538
Yeah, that would work for me. Yeah, so I can put a bunch of them.

173
00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:46.348
We did agree. I think that our November session that we would track the issues through the GitHub.

174
00:17:46.348 --> 00:17:55.048
Um, and so once we get to the housekeeping, we can talk about how we we shift.

175
00:17:55.048 --> 00:17:58.469
Um, from.

176
00:17:58.469 --> 00:18:07.048
A work in progress to an adopt a document, but both of them being used not used both of them using GitHub.

177
00:18:07.048 --> 00:18:11.398
And again, using the issues to track.

178
00:18:11.398 --> 00:18:15.509
Yeah, yeah, we were thinking of maybe having a folder.

179
00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:30.239
Or directory in the GitHub that was unsubmitted drafts and another 1 for submitted drafts. Perhaps maybe you could add some tooling in there that could just make files, submit it for you or something like that, too.

180
00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:33.239
If we can.

181
00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:36.989
Automation of this going. Okay.

182
00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:42.179
So, it's the notion of renaming and.

183
00:18:42.179 --> 00:18:48.328
The repo from the unsubmitted or the unapproved.

184
00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:53.159
Or yet, to be approved, whatever we want to call the folder to adopted.

185
00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:59.009
Right. So we'll have a repo that talks about the adopted draft not talks about, but.

186
00:18:59.009 --> 00:19:03.088
Um, has the view of all of the adopted draft.

187
00:19:03.088 --> 00:19:06.298
In there.

188
00:19:06.298 --> 00:19:12.419
And typically, in the other working groups that I chair, we've.

189
00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:24.088
We've had 2 separate get hubs and then what they do is they just, they do have to rename the drafts because before they get adopted, it's typically.

190
00:19:24.088 --> 00:19:32.638
Draft Dash, somebody's last name dash skin Dash, whatever the.

191
00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:36.269
Um, there's a naming convention is what I'm trying to say.

192
00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:43.138
Gotcha and then once it's adopted, then it becomes a draft dash dash skin.

193
00:19:43.138 --> 00:19:46.409
And that's.

194
00:19:46.409 --> 00:19:52.798
Effectively the convention that gets you, so that people understand what's been adopted and what's not.

195
00:19:52.798 --> 00:19:56.548
Just by looking at the file name.

196
00:19:56.548 --> 00:20:00.568
Sounds good. Well, work through that. I'm sure. Yes.

197
00:20:00.568 --> 00:20:03.628
Okay, so, um.

198
00:20:03.628 --> 00:20:08.489
Is the same process that being followed for both the schema and the protocol.

199
00:20:10.618 --> 00:20:13.709
I, I was, that's it. That's our intent.

200
00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:16.888
Okay, and, uh.

201
00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:20.278
So, at our last intro meeting, uh, I.

202
00:20:20.278 --> 00:20:29.933
Put the idea out there of kind of, you know, do we stick down the path of 2.0 and I, I sort of made it like, uh, you can only choose 1, which maybe that's not actually how we should have approached it.

203
00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:42.503
Um, uh, do we push to move skim 2.0 to Internet draft or do we just sort of, you know, pivot turn our focus towards, uh, like the next iteration of scale informally? Call it skim 3.0 um.

204
00:20:46.709 --> 00:20:53.423
And I think we have, we had a general consensus in the last interim for support of, like, moving the standard forward.

205
00:20:54.054 --> 00:20:54.772
Uh,

206
00:20:54.983 --> 00:20:55.794
so I,

207
00:20:55.794 --> 00:20:57.503
I had a chance to consult with,

208
00:20:57.564 --> 00:20:58.223
uh,

209
00:20:58.673 --> 00:20:58.913
uh,

210
00:20:58.913 --> 00:20:59.933
1 of my peers at Microsoft,

211
00:21:00.054 --> 00:21:00.713
Mark wall,

212
00:21:00.713 --> 00:21:06.683
who've got some experience in the standards world and his feedback on the idea of,

213
00:21:06.713 --> 00:21:07.044
uh,

214
00:21:07.074 --> 00:21:07.284
like,

215
00:21:07.284 --> 00:21:09.054
sort of trying to go for skim 3.0 was,

216
00:21:09.054 --> 00:21:09.354
uh,

217
00:21:09.683 --> 00:21:10.223
essentially,

218
00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:12.534
if we try to write 1,

219
00:21:12.534 --> 00:21:13.794
big epic it's,

220
00:21:13.884 --> 00:21:14.364
uh,

221
00:21:14.394 --> 00:21:15.023
you know,

222
00:21:15.054 --> 00:21:18.114
and include everything that everybody wants to do a standard,

223
00:21:18.114 --> 00:21:18.173
uh,

224
00:21:18.173 --> 00:21:22.493
moving it forward and getting progress could be a lot harder versus sort of.

225
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:29.338
Put like stopping at 2.0 and just extending it, uh, further with, uh.

226
00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:34.769
A, a long list of extensions, and I'm not experienced enough. Like, I.

227
00:21:34.769 --> 00:21:43.439
I I want this to sort of come up for a discussion. I don't know if this is the right channel or if we actually dedicate some time for it in the, the more supplementary to talk about it.

228
00:21:44.848 --> 00:21:49.648
We probably should allocate some time at the preliminary.

229
00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:59.038
To discuss yeah, like, I, I think.

230
00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:02.159
Um, given the milestones that we.

231
00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:07.019
Have currently and the, and the charter, it makes sense that.

232
00:22:07.019 --> 00:22:11.068
For now, at least we start by.

233
00:22:11.068 --> 00:22:15.959
Trying to move 2.0 from proposed draft to Internet draft. Uh.

234
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:22.648
And, you know, whatever that entails, you know, processing of rata, any small clarification changes, et cetera uh, that.

235
00:22:22.648 --> 00:22:35.578
Even if we do later, decide to target, like, the, the big new epic of 3.0, uh, that probably serves as a good base of, uh, you know, processing through all of the, the small problems with 2.0 cause we do want to.

236
00:22:35.578 --> 00:22:40.919
You know, whatever we build next, whether it's, you know, 2000 extensions, it's 2.0 are.

237
00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:48.179
3.0, we probably want to be backwards compatible as much as possible for, you know, an easier like, upgrade path of implementation.

238
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:56.699
That is absolutely true. The interoperability and backward compatibility is something. Yeah.

239
00:22:58.138 --> 00:23:01.709
We didn't explicitly write that in the charter, but, um.

240
00:23:01.709 --> 00:23:06.868
Yeah, yeah, like, I'm I I feel like I'm, I'm mostly.

241
00:23:06.868 --> 00:23:15.419
Personally, indifferent to, you know, uh, 2000 extensions versus right. Uh, entirely new, you know, 3.0 spec, um.

242
00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:22.348
But I, I think for now, at least, you know, the more conservative course of action, while we figure that out is probably to.

243
00:23:22.348 --> 00:23:26.338
Move 2.0 forward to that final stage and then we.

244
00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:30.328
I can just pull on that if we need to the current.

245
00:23:30.328 --> 00:23:36.388
Mechanism so everybody knows is is can be done in the path.

246
00:23:36.388 --> 00:23:41.429
So you're supposed to be able to go slash v2 for skim 2.

247
00:23:41.429 --> 00:23:44.699
Cause we went through this with skim 1 versus skim 2.

248
00:23:44.699 --> 00:23:52.588
So, if it's V2 dot 1, if there's an incompatibilities, you would introduce a new path. And then a server would either default.

249
00:23:52.588 --> 00:23:55.858
To the latest, and if somebody just wants.

250
00:23:55.858 --> 00:24:01.229
Um, to still talk to him to, he would say, slash slash.

251
00:24:01.229 --> 00:24:06.088
Users and so on um, so that's the current mechanism.

252
00:24:06.088 --> 00:24:12.989
It's probably not well implemented.

253
00:24:15.328 --> 00:24:19.348
I was sorry somewhere. Well.

254
00:24:19.348 --> 00:24:22.618
So, fill the question is well implemented.

255
00:24:22.618 --> 00:24:32.878
Because it's lacking specificity in any documents, or I think, because we haven't really had.

256
00:24:32.878 --> 00:24:39.628
A major change, like, skin 1 was was dramatically different, had a lot of interrupt problems.

257
00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:42.719
Tended to be either 2 or 1.

258
00:24:42.719 --> 00:24:51.598
Now, we're talking about a scenario where we could have coexistence for a period of time. Whereas 1, and 2 really didn't coexist.

259
00:24:51.598 --> 00:25:00.449
Got it, the pm's in the room may be able to comment, but I, I guess not on my experience. I think you're right on the.

260
00:25:00.449 --> 00:25:04.588
2 to 3 that people who adopt it to me.

261
00:25:04.588 --> 00:25:08.459
Stay there quite some time before they go to 3, depending on.

262
00:25:08.459 --> 00:25:11.669
What 3 looks like so.

263
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:17.638
Or maybe that's because it's hard to get rid of a standard once it's established. Right?

264
00:25:17.638 --> 00:25:25.888
Well, it, is it a big shift from a 2 to a 3 or is it like a 2 dot 1?

265
00:25:25.888 --> 00:25:29.459
I guess at that point, it doesn't matter. It's a different version.

266
00:25:29.459 --> 00:25:33.628
Maybe we follow taking shape.

267
00:25:33.628 --> 00:25:40.618
Let me give you an example, which I'm not sure isn't a router. Maybe you could comment and see in the patch command.

268
00:25:40.618 --> 00:25:44.939
We had ad replace and removed for an attribute.

269
00:25:44.939 --> 00:25:55.618
And when you have a multi, when you have an attribute, and somebody says what, if I just said replace and if the value doesn't exist, it'll just add the value.

270
00:25:55.618 --> 00:26:00.118
Speck is unclear on that and people are wondering, should I throw an error.

271
00:26:00.118 --> 00:26:03.659
Or should I just be cooperative and add the value.

272
00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:10.229
And that's the question. I get a lot of times and it's unspecified in the spec.

273
00:26:10.229 --> 00:26:16.288
Right. So if you add clarification that says, yeah, just go ahead and add the value.

274
00:26:16.288 --> 00:26:26.999
For some people, you're making a functional change, but for other people, you're reaffirming what they already decided to do, which is to be generally cooperative with the protocol.

275
00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:32.848
And that's the kind of issue where we have a few corner cases like that, where.

276
00:26:32.848 --> 00:26:40.588
Some people might have been stripped, particularly if you came out of the X500 community where everything was break if it's not exactly on.

277
00:26:40.588 --> 00:26:45.568
And then there's the rest community, which says, well, if you understand it, let it go ahead.

278
00:26:45.568 --> 00:26:56.128
And that's how I sort of answered that question. If you understand it, let it go ahead and some people that drives him nuts. So yeah. Okay.

279
00:26:56.128 --> 00:26:59.368
So, is that I'm irada or or is it a.

280
00:27:00.568 --> 00:27:04.318
But it's a backwards compatible. I would argue for the most part.

281
00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:09.358
Right, I mean, I, I would say screw it more as an Errata in.

282
00:27:09.358 --> 00:27:14.128
In that we're making clarifications on the intent, but.

283
00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:28.318
Yeah, well or do we follow in the steps of Aaron who Ha, they put a best practice doc together for it should be at the best best, best practice doc together for skim.

284
00:27:28.318 --> 00:27:40.709
But that fit in that doc, that that's a great example, because 1 of the ones that people keep saying, I need cursor based paging is because there's a limit and skim on how many results you can get.

285
00:27:40.709 --> 00:27:44.278
But if you're in the spec, it's optional.

286
00:27:44.278 --> 00:27:47.878
It's not also for the client, right?

287
00:27:47.878 --> 00:27:56.098
For the server well, that's something that we can discuss as a group and get consensus on. I mean.

288
00:27:56.098 --> 00:28:00.778
I'm here to help guide the group as is Aaron, right?

289
00:28:00.778 --> 00:28:03.898
You're kind of reminding me of.

290
00:28:03.898 --> 00:28:07.528
The scope and the bounds that we need to put on.

291
00:28:07.528 --> 00:28:11.909
What's on on the bounds of.

292
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:15.929
The functioning capabilities of the protocols and the schema.

293
00:28:15.929 --> 00:28:22.558
Versus the common practice to get that level of interoperability.

294
00:28:22.558 --> 00:28:28.378
So, we had some of these discussions in, for example.

295
00:28:28.378 --> 00:28:32.009
In the framework.

296
00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:37.499
As well, as in the radius for doing authentications and.

297
00:28:37.499 --> 00:28:44.818
Specifically for radius, the boundary was more of anything to do with.

298
00:28:44.818 --> 00:28:51.509
Beyond the authentication decision, which gets into the policy room.

299
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:55.588
Was outside the scope and so I can tell you in that group.

300
00:28:55.588 --> 00:29:00.659
We didn't even have a common practice for topics like that cause they said it was out of scope.

301
00:29:08.338 --> 00:29:11.939
But what you described Phil, to me, is.

302
00:29:11.939 --> 00:29:16.769
You know, it's sort of in the scope.

303
00:29:16.769 --> 00:29:21.598
From a state machine perspective, which is why I would construct Morris and Nevada.

304
00:29:21.598 --> 00:29:25.979
Aaron, I don't know if you have a voice since your Co chair as well.

305
00:29:25.979 --> 00:29:37.588
Yeah, it's a tough 1. do you have a sense of how of what the current state of deployments do? Like, is there a way to survey the deployments and see how many fall on which end of that?

306
00:29:37.588 --> 00:29:44.189
Decision was made, I don't know, to be honest 1 of the things.

307
00:29:44.189 --> 00:29:48.298
Icf doesn't do that people ask about as a certification suite.

308
00:29:48.298 --> 00:29:53.939
Just from the experience of open ID, there are what the specs there are always.

309
00:29:53.939 --> 00:30:00.989
I'm going to call them behaviors. They're always what the spec says, and then there are common patterns and behaviors.

310
00:30:00.989 --> 00:30:06.118
And the great thing that test suite does is it captures the behaviors.

311
00:30:06.118 --> 00:30:11.788
So you can say, well, you're compliant, but you are doing something weird.

312
00:30:11.788 --> 00:30:15.058
And that tends to get exposed in compliance.

313
00:30:15.058 --> 00:30:18.719
Uh, are you testing because the test suites.

314
00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:23.278
Would tend to sort of in this case, uh, that I said that.

315
00:30:23.278 --> 00:30:33.239
The last week that they, they would sort of say, oh, patch with, uh, replace on a value that doesn't exist works. Okay. And the test suite accepts that and then.

316
00:30:33.239 --> 00:30:36.989
It sort of becomes an implied back.

317
00:30:36.989 --> 00:30:43.078
The other, you know, what what's been interesting is and both the TLS.

318
00:30:43.078 --> 00:30:46.858
And the mask working group.

319
00:30:46.858 --> 00:30:53.368
Not mass sorry quick. They had been holding and.

320
00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:56.788
I believe that quick stone.

321
00:30:56.788 --> 00:31:00.538
These interrupt tests.

322
00:31:00.538 --> 00:31:07.499
More to ensure the maturity and the interoperability of implementations.

323
00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:10.828
Based on what's been authored in the specs.

324
00:31:12.689 --> 00:31:18.239
So, if this group is interested in doing that, right? Um.

325
00:31:19.739 --> 00:31:23.729
We can hold sessions to that effect. Um.

326
00:31:25.048 --> 00:31:31.618
But, again, it's all driven by, you know, the energy and and the momentum.

327
00:31:31.618 --> 00:31:40.648
That this group wants to follow, but what you're saying does make sense to Phil.

328
00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:46.288
I'm a big fan of of test suites as well. Um, the other thing that helps.

329
00:31:46.288 --> 00:31:53.128
Is it forces the spec, it kind of pieces out those ambiguities in the spec because once you're creating a test suite.

330
00:31:53.128 --> 00:31:58.348
You realise that you end up, sort of, with these little holes that you then.

331
00:31:58.348 --> 00:32:01.919
Go back and plug, but the, um.

332
00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:14.068
The other the other sort of official channel is the Hackathon so the, the goal of the Hackathon so, for those who are not familiar.

333
00:32:14.068 --> 00:32:20.608
While we were doing it, virtually it, it was extended for the whole week before.

334
00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:28.378
The, the sessions now with the hybrid, I believe they start Friday.

335
00:32:28.378 --> 00:32:32.759
I'm not arriving till Saturday, but anyway.

336
00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:46.048
The skin working group can sign up to have a table reserved and that's where we can do, you know, plug fast interrupt testing.

337
00:32:46.048 --> 00:32:55.798
Call it what you like I can tell you in the deep working group we started by just having a table on having the discussion of.

338
00:32:55.798 --> 00:32:59.308
The realm of interoperability.

339
00:32:59.308 --> 00:33:04.979
Because in the 1st, couple of sessions, we didn't have implementation.

340
00:33:04.979 --> 00:33:09.298
But now we do, and and they do.

341
00:33:09.298 --> 00:33:14.189
There are 3, 3 vendors.

342
00:33:14.189 --> 00:33:19.499
That continue and again, the purpose is to ensure.

343
00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:30.479
That the, the drafts are both implementable that we can reach some level of interoperability.

344
00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:38.699
So, I, I would absolutely encourage this group.

345
00:33:38.699 --> 00:33:42.118
To at least participate in the hackathons.

346
00:33:42.118 --> 00:33:50.999
That's not as demanding sort of in that they they meet, but there is a lot of prep work.

347
00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:55.169
Because you do have to do the coding, um.

348
00:33:55.169 --> 00:33:59.939
But they do meet the weekend before begins.

349
00:33:59.939 --> 00:34:05.009
The other option is to follow, I don't think it's.

350
00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:12.358
Officially through the, but I'm being TLS so widespread.

351
00:34:12.358 --> 00:34:16.588
That both the TLS working group and a quick working group have, um.

352
00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:19.708
Set up their own, you know.

353
00:34:21.358 --> 00:34:25.469
Mechanisms for doing interoperability.

354
00:34:29.364 --> 00:34:42.474
Might be worth spending more time on the test suites because, um, I found a couple of test suite and there were a lot of issues with them but, uh, it's worth spending time saying what.

355
00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:50.878
A test we should test. Okay.

356
00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.809
My understanding Nancy, maybe you can clarify is.

357
00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:03.568
The typically doesn't do test suites. Usually it's an independent work that picks it up. Like.

358
00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:06.838
Open ID for correct.

359
00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:12.088
Correct there was 2000, which was somebody else.

360
00:35:13.318 --> 00:35:18.208
I, I would say we, it's not in the scope of the.

361
00:35:18.208 --> 00:35:24.989
That is correct yeah, but, you know, this helped with interoperability testing.

362
00:35:26.128 --> 00:35:36.958
Yep, if if you work with the test suite, and it's fine with the test suite, then interoperability gives you a higher confidence of of the things working together.

363
00:35:40.018 --> 00:35:54.148
Yeah, okay. I'm going to need to cut off this discussion since we have a couple of other agenda items, but these are all good topics. The testing is absolutely not in the charter.

364
00:35:54.148 --> 00:35:58.139
Or in our groups charter.

365
00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:02.789
Um, but it is an activity that can be discussed.

366
00:36:02.789 --> 00:36:07.978
You know, off as we look to ensure that what we're.

367
00:36:07.978 --> 00:36:11.219
I look at it as a, um.

368
00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:17.699
As a tool to ensure the validity of what.

369
00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:30.659
We're drafting. Okay. Um, let's keep moving on Danny. If you wouldn't mind I just want to make sure we have enough time.

370
00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:38.429
To cover the housekeeping, because I want to make sure jenelle has some time to talk about the GitHub.

371
00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:42.239
That she helped set up, um.

372
00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:45.568
So this shouldn't take long. Yeah.

373
00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:59.398
Just so just to close the loop on the schema and protocol there hasn't really been any pen to paper. At this point. It's all been just thinking about, like, strategy and of, like, what actions to take before taking them uh, I'm not too worried.

374
00:36:59.398 --> 00:37:13.318
About how long it'll take to get us to get all the Arata and clarifications process is I think it's a much smaller body of work than, uh, say the work going on with use cases where it's, you know, pretty much a full rewrite.

375
00:37:13.318 --> 00:37:25.498
Um, so moving on to the photos, uh, topic, uh, so, something that, uh, I, I've seen as, uh, in, like, the fast provisioning space.

376
00:37:25.498 --> 00:37:30.148
That, um, is sort of highly desired, but also.

377
00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:45.059
On the border of not being implementable is, uh, uh, skim client sending, uh, especially over the Internet, uh, the, uh, for, uh, profile picture for a user object.

378
00:37:46.224 --> 00:37:56.244
The skin standard today says just include a URL that points to where the picture is and the, uh, this game server can then go back and read the picture from that.

379
00:37:56.753 --> 00:38:07.643
And there's no discussion in, uh, the spec about how to handle, uh, authorization or, uh, authentication against that URL to secure the picture. So that other parties cannot.

380
00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:15.239
Go and, you know, traverse a list of all pictures in a directory, for instance. Uh, and so that's a topic that I would like to.

381
00:38:15.239 --> 00:38:19.260
I, you know, at some point and figure out how to solve, uh, I.

382
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:33.090
It like, I know that it's a problem I need smarter brains in mind so it's just sort of a like a call for interest. If anybody has interest in helping to solve that problem and write a draft on it. Um.

383
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:38.579
Please so, are you, are you talking about a case where.

384
00:38:38.579 --> 00:38:41.969
You post the URL for the picture.

385
00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:46.079
And then the skim server behind the scene loads it or something or.

386
00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:57.690
Because normally, the original spec was just that it's just a data field that you served back and its authenticity is up to whoever administrative in the 1st place before it goes in. So, the skim server is just.

387
00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:06.150
A data store in that regard, but solving the problem about whether it's a valid image and all the other stuff was up to.

388
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.420
The client that set it where the client that received it.

389
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.260
1 might be a web that receives it from the directory.

390
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.760
Um, the other 1 was an administrative that said it in the 1st place.

391
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.150
So, it sounds like within the protocol standpoint.

392
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:29.519
How does it say something within the CIA triad? What David is talking about is the C not so much the I is that right? Danny.

393
00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:37.469
Uh, I don't know what CIA is. Oh, confidentiality integrity and, uh, authenticity. So, uh, yeah, I'm confidentiality.

394
00:39:37.469 --> 00:39:41.730
Right. Okay. Uh, and I would say the speck is agnostic.

395
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:52.530
For those issues right now. Well, I guess what I'm trying to understand is whether the question is that the field should have confidentiality, but it doesn't today.

396
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:58.349
So, there's, there's 2 things that we need to ensure that, um.

397
00:39:58.349 --> 00:40:04.110
Were clean on as we update the protocol and the schema is that we are.

398
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.289
We are absolutely providing.

399
00:40:07.289 --> 00:40:10.889
The security mechanisms as well as the privacy.

400
00:40:10.889 --> 00:40:15.630
Um, of the information that gets conveyed there.

401
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:21.269
So, um, I'm not sure that all of it is in scope. Danny.

402
00:40:21.269 --> 00:40:24.360
So, I'm still trying to understand the full.

403
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.599
Extent of what you were describing.

404
00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:33.119
It's what you're talking about, their access control that describes.

405
00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:36.809
What records you can see and what fields you can see. Okay.

406
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.070
Cause that's not in the spec, either. That's another.

407
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.429
I can provide a proposal that.

408
00:40:44.429 --> 00:40:54.449
But I, I don't see, you need to have that in the spec, in order to encourage broad interoperability. It's not in the Eld app. Spec, for example.

409
00:40:54.449 --> 00:40:57.900
And, yeah, we ran into brick wall, converting.

410
00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:03.420
And now that from everybody's proprietary access controls to a standard 1.

411
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.769
It's the need for a standard wasn't clear.

412
00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:10.800
There might be here, um.

413
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:19.320
But it's a big it's a big thing. Yeah. Yeah. I think part of the thing is that it's.

414
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.619
This cross domain.

415
00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:34.889
Aspect of skim and crossing boundaries, you know, within an context and you've got your server in your local data stores. That's 1 thing but now we're trying to share this data between 2 different.

416
00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:38.519
You know, and also comment.

417
00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:43.409
That the policy world is changing in a couple of dramatic ways.

418
00:41:43.409 --> 00:41:49.500
Well, outside the, but also how people are handling it so.

419
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.920
I'm working on 2 specs.

420
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:58.170
Uh, 1 in the cloud native thing called open policy.

421
00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:01.440
Which involves, um.

422
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.610
How you integrate interconnect with policy systems?

423
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:13.199
So, it's an open policy agent and that's that's more about code. And and how you build things.

424
00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:17.579
And then there's another 1, that's more formal called identity query language.

425
00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:21.599
That is coming out about generalizing.

426
00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:25.079
Policy in the cloud around the identity.

427
00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:30.510
And there's interplay possibilities to scale with skim with both.

428
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:36.570
But they're taking a vastly different tack than we've all done before.

429
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:44.159
So, I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here is there's a lot happening. I'm not sure now it's the right time for the skim work group to pick it up.

430
00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:50.250
I agree I think there's a lot happening in that area and, uh, we could get behind.

431
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.610
If we tried to do it just for skin.

432
00:42:56.635 --> 00:43:10.045
Okay, so I just want to make sure as much for the notes as my own edification. I'm understanding Danny's request, which which is if I'm a skin client and saying, all right go create these users and oh, by the way here are some photos for these users today.

433
00:43:10.284 --> 00:43:24.594
I have to pass a URL that is world readable. Right? It has to be a URL that this kind of server can go then fetch those pictures from. And Danny's point is well, that's bad because anyone could discover those URLs and then go fetch all the photos for every employee in my organization.

434
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.769
The skin servers shouldn't be catching.

435
00:43:28.769 --> 00:43:34.409
Photos that's not the intent. We don't say that we do that. Y, you.

436
00:43:34.409 --> 00:43:37.949
The skim server just serves up the URL that was given.

437
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:45.420
I see and then if there's a concept, the file that controls access to the photo, that's the way I've interpreted it.

438
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.559
Well, but the question does, does the skin server.

439
00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:54.449
No, so this gets to the confidentiality, right?

440
00:43:54.449 --> 00:44:01.440
Does the skim server is that field in the here? Basically.

441
00:44:01.914 --> 00:44:07.914
Well, is any is any information diverged within the string text of the URL?

442
00:44:07.974 --> 00:44:18.684
If the answer to that is no, then it's up to the server that's serving the photo to enforce authorization and actually see the content of the URL.

443
00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:24.420
That's correct unless you serve unless you the best explicitly store, the photo.

444
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.539
Through the protocol directly as a binary.

445
00:44:27.539 --> 00:44:31.469
You're just storing a URL in retrieving a URL.

446
00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:38.039
The servers should not be fetching it's not part of the protocol for the server to do something in the background. That would be.

447
00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:42.150
Outside the spec, it can do that, but the spec.

448
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:49.230
It's just store and retrieve 1 of all time.

449
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:59.250
Because I still want to know to cover the housekeeping. I think it does matter. So, Danny, we can.

450
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:12.329
Have you spent some time maybe? Well, I got to look at the agenda which I want to spend more time on too. I think that's a great discussion though. I don't want to interrupt it. Well.

451
00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:17.400
Yeah, we only have 10 minutes left, right?

452
00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:28.434
Okay um, so sorry, I do have all the time keeper here. We will pick that hot topic. So so, Danny, it does sound like it's a topic that we should continue.

453
00:45:29.545 --> 00:45:34.074
I encourage you to bring it up in the slack channel.

454
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.530
And then mail group yeah, I'll do that.

455
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:46.110
And then if we have time, and if you want to continue the discussion in the planaria and.

456
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:51.300
113, let me know, and I can add it to the agenda.

457
00:45:52.739 --> 00:45:57.449
Okay, so now.

458
00:45:57.864 --> 00:46:10.974
Right. Um, I've created yet another skim GitHub. Repo. I know that there was 1 previously. Um, and I'm just seeking agreement to adopt it and use it.

459
00:46:11.005 --> 00:46:13.375
Not just have it be this submitted.

460
00:46:13.679 --> 00:46:18.719
Accepted adopted drafts, but be a working place that we can all.

461
00:46:18.719 --> 00:46:27.210
Work with, I can link it up maybe to the mailing list so that it can update the mailing list when people check things in um.

462
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:30.780
And I've shared it with.

463
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:41.519
Nancy, Aaron, Danny and Pam, I can, I can share it with others. Is is that okay okay. Thing for us to do? Nancy?

464
00:46:41.519 --> 00:46:47.940
Well, I think so. I so Aaron and I discussed it and.

465
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:52.829
As long as we can have within the skin.

466
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:57.539
And this is where my brain's not working this morning. Um.

467
00:46:57.539 --> 00:47:03.690
So, in the skin get hub project, if we can create.

468
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:07.860
2 distinct some projects.

469
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:12.690
1 project is the adopted documents.

470
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:15.989
The other 1 is the work in progress.

471
00:47:15.989 --> 00:47:24.599
And that way, your work in progress is where the folks who are still working on documents that haven't been adopted yet.

472
00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:28.619
Can use and track.

473
00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:32.039
Their work, but then once.

474
00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:36.300
I'm expecting like, the use cases and the base schema and protocol.

475
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:43.559
Once those get adopted than they move from that sub project from the work in progress to be adopted.

476
00:47:44.639 --> 00:47:51.090
Um, and so I I couldn't remember if that's the way.

477
00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:56.789
If you had created it as a project, I just created a repo called scam.

478
00:47:56.789 --> 00:48:04.500
And I can create multiple repos, or I could have 1 repo with multiple folders in the repo where we could move files from here to there.

479
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:12.059
Work in project or something? Yeah, it could have 2 separate separate. You'd have project projects.

480
00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:19.829
I don't know if anybody has already done this in other groups but what I've typically seen is a repo per draft.

481
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:23.099
And, uh, the nice thing about that is it keeps the issues.

482
00:48:23.875 --> 00:48:38.664
On a repo, and then the issues are associated with a particular draft. So, um, this may be only a problem in larger groups where there sometimes are drafts that people are not interested in and only interested in some and lets you manage discussions better that way.

483
00:48:38.969 --> 00:48:42.420
That's typically how I've seen it done though.

484
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:48.420
Yeah, so this is oh, sorry if I can just explain so.

485
00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.050
This is where I get lost in in the vocabulary, right? Because.

486
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:55.860
For the wraps working group, I've created an organization.

487
00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.670
Which I think of is it's a GitHub you go to GitHub.

488
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:06.000
Blah, blah racks and then there there is a separate repo.

489
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.909
For each of the drafts now and all the other working groups, we've only, um.

490
00:49:11.909 --> 00:49:18.000
We only allow the adopted drafts in those organizations, or right?

491
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:25.440
But I haven't gone deeper right into which is why I was calling them a project.

492
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.159
Or an organization than having someone's underneath.

493
00:49:29.159 --> 00:49:42.804
Which I think is doable. My apologies I cut someone off. Yeah, I think that that's a really good, uh, suggestion, Erin and Nancy, so this is such a new thing.

494
00:49:42.864 --> 00:49:46.824
There's not much going on cause we've been treading very lately a little bit scared.

495
00:49:47.159 --> 00:49:54.929
To start doing things until we kinda came to an agreement um, I can create multiple repos for the different drafts.

496
00:49:54.929 --> 00:49:59.730
We'd like to do that. Yeah. Work in progress. Thanks.

497
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:03.449
Now, let me, let me take a look at it again.

498
00:50:03.449 --> 00:50:09.719
Right, right so the gating thing is and again, typically we.

499
00:50:09.719 --> 00:50:14.099
We only grant access to the authors.

500
00:50:14.099 --> 00:50:19.710
For actual now, I don't remember I have to go back and look.

501
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:27.510
Before I speak. Um, no, that sounds that sounds right only the authors get right access to it. Anybody is able to.

502
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:32.699
You know, send a pull request to suggest changes, but only the editors can merge.

503
00:50:32.699 --> 00:50:38.579
Yeah, and so that's administrators would would manage that, which would be the chairs.

504
00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:45.480
I think Phil wanted to something so, 1 of the things I want to be cautious of, because 1 of the.

505
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:50.250
Things as it was an author, you're trying to trigger the group to read your content.

506
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:54.210
So the only thing that they cautious of is the work in progress.

507
00:50:54.210 --> 00:51:00.539
You want to do it in a way that doesn't generate noise because then people stop reading anything.

508
00:51:00.539 --> 00:51:04.800
Um, and so I like the idea of.

509
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:11.789
If it's just holding the working group jobs and and per project so you can say I'm focusing on.

510
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:20.280
The, uh, W, whatever the draft is, and I want to post an issue for it. So I think that's going to work really well, because it helps.

511
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.309
Solve the problem that the mailing list has had.

512
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:31.079
The work in progress that's sort of maybe their the authors are going to work in a branch that the general public isn't seeing.

513
00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:35.309
And the reason for that is that you're trying not to.

514
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:40.380
Distract people with the noise you want them to say, okay, I've publish this. Go and read it now.

515
00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:45.360
Supported by the efforts of the chairs to, to, to remind people.

516
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.469
Um, but I, I, I sort of conscious of noise.

517
00:51:49.469 --> 00:51:53.909
Oh, okay. You know, it's not authors going back and forth. You don't want to.

518
00:51:53.909 --> 00:51:57.869
The stare of everyone, so not every check in gets.

519
00:51:57.869 --> 00:52:03.750
Sent to the mailing list. All right. Uh, yeah, I think that's a good suggestion to you.

520
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:08.610
I would say anytime you publish it to the document engine.

521
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:13.889
It should be in the GitHub also published in the main master branch.

522
00:52:13.889 --> 00:52:20.880
Whatever you call it, um, and then you also publish the engine so it's formally registered.

523
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:28.050
And then that's your trigger to let everybody know, okay. Draft 3 is there a draft or is there and so on? But.

524
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:32.369
As you as the authors are revising that drafts.

525
00:52:32.369 --> 00:52:38.099
The general worker probably isn't interested unless they choose to follow it and get hub.

526
00:52:38.099 --> 00:52:43.320
I think that's it. Yeah, it's a great way of saying it and that's again, I think the benefit of.

527
00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:57.690
Organizing it as a repo per draft so that, um, as a, you know, as as someone who's on GitHub, you can choose to watch particular repos and and you'll get notifications of of issues in only the ones that you're watching and you can turn off.

528
00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:01.710
Notifications, if you don't want to follow the details of a particular 1.

529
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:07.320
Um, the individual commits aren't really like, pushed anywhere and nobody sees those anyway.

530
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:12.420
Unless we hook up a bot to report those to the mailing list, which I don't think is a good idea.

531
00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:21.179
But it's mainly the issues that get the sort of traffic and the discussion going and being able to filter those.

532
00:53:21.179 --> 00:53:24.239
To choose which ones to tune in to is really helpful.

533
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.079
Okay, do I have any volunteers that want to help me to structure this?

534
00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:36.539
In our, I'm happy to help, I can help you to know. I mean.

535
00:53:36.539 --> 00:53:45.150
Aaron, and I will be the the ultimate administrators anyway, so yeah, you totally are. You know, I welcome your.

536
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:52.949
Guidance, but, uh, at sometimes, sometimes it just feels like just the collaboration is impeding us at the moment. I think when we get that going that.

537
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:58.110
Start cooking with gas.

538
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.739
Ok, with that, I've got 1 minute left.

539
00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:09.239
So this is what I have is a tentative agenda and Danny.

540
00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:17.489
Depending on the times that we want to spend on the bulk of the work, meaning the use cases protocol and schema.

541
00:54:17.489 --> 00:54:22.590
If you want to add the, I'll call it confidential fields for now.

542
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.590
You were referring it to it as the.

543
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:37.110
Photos I can add that, but, um, something for you to know. And I'll, I'll ping Pam too. And how much time you think you'll need.

544
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:41.610
To cover each of them we.

545
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:46.019
So, given our last.

546
00:54:46.019 --> 00:54:55.019
Meeting I only asked for 12 hour session, moving forward. Once we pick up the momentum we can ask for more time.

547
00:54:55.019 --> 00:54:59.159
So, currently we have 2 hours allocated.

548
00:54:59.159 --> 00:55:03.090
We have about an hour and a half left.

549
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:06.360
Um, for these.

550
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:13.739
These meetings, sorry for the main. And then Danny, if you want me to add the other 1.

551
00:55:13.739 --> 00:55:20.130
We can add that as well or you can bring it up in the context of, um.

552
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:23.340
The protocol and schema discussion.

553
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:34.920
You can pull that in there too, because for me what what you're discussing yeah. What you're discussing also goes to the security and the privacy considerations.

554
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.880
Um, the threat modeling, right?

555
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:45.030
And privacy modeling for what we want to standardize.

556
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:47.219
Sorry,

557
00:55:47.215 --> 00:55:49.974
you were gonna say something um,

558
00:55:50.005 --> 00:55:50.215
yeah,

559
00:55:50.244 --> 00:55:50.755
just that,

560
00:55:51.054 --> 00:55:51.684
um,

561
00:55:51.804 --> 00:55:53.994
I don't have a strong preference 1 way,

562
00:55:53.994 --> 00:55:57.324
or the other of if we try to solve this,

563
00:55:57.355 --> 00:55:57.684
I guess,

564
00:55:57.684 --> 00:55:58.344
as part of,

565
00:55:58.885 --> 00:55:59.065
like,

566
00:55:59.065 --> 00:56:00.625
the main protocol line,

567
00:56:00.625 --> 00:56:01.585
or if it just,

568
00:56:01.795 --> 00:56:02.065
you know,

569
00:56:02.094 --> 00:56:05.965
get get a rag tag group of people together and write a draft to at least,

570
00:56:06.295 --> 00:56:06.505
you know,

571
00:56:06.505 --> 00:56:08.545
have a way to address the the problem.

572
00:56:11.639 --> 00:56:15.269
So, how are we yeah, I guess, uh, you know.

573
00:56:15.269 --> 00:56:19.769
Structure it, administratively of where we're trying to put the solution.

574
00:56:19.769 --> 00:56:28.320
Right now, it's not feeling to me as a separate draft, as I mentioned to me, it's feeling more like a security consideration and privacy.

575
00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:32.130
Um, and it could, and I misunderstanding the problem, right?

576
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:39.900
But, let's absolutely get that in the open. All right, so I can ping you guys, um.

577
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:46.139
In the next day or 2 give you time to think about it, but I do need to post a rough agenda.

578
00:56:46.139 --> 00:56:50.820
I think by the end of this week, if I'm not already.

579
00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:54.119
Um, to the website. Okay.

580
00:56:54.119 --> 00:56:57.329
I apologize I ran us 1 minute over time.

581
00:56:57.329 --> 00:57:02.760
Thank you everyone for joining the call. We will see you.

582
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.260
And Vienna, either virtually or in person.

583
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:14.610
All right. Thanks everyone thanks.

584
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:19.199
Bye bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

585
00:57:19.199 --> 00:57:19.980
Hello.
